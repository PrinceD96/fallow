New rows seed from the manifest; removed rows drop.\n\nThe first generation adds 9 previously undocumented commands and 14 issue-type rows, each with its exact copy-pasteable suppression comment, while preserving all existing curated prose. The release flow regenerates the canonical fallow-skills tables against the fresh release binary before re-vendoring, with --check as the drift gate; generator unit tests run in the js-lint CI job.

The direct fixture correlation already credited page-object methods, but wrapper test objects lost the fixture definition side of that correlation, so `unused-class-members` reported methods that were only reached through merged or extended fixtures.\n\nThis adds a conservative Playwright fixture alias sentinel in extraction and expands those aliases in the unused-member analyzer with a bounded, deduped fixed-point pass. The import gate only accepts Playwright's named `mergeTests` import, including aliased imports, and unmatched wrapper aliases do not credit anything. Namespace imports remain out of scope.\n\nRegression coverage includes extractor alias tests, a full issue fixture covering direct, merged, extended, and transitive wrapper paths, and controls proving genuinely unused decorated methods still report.\n\nFixes #1210.",

Token-identical sorted import blocks are a formatting artifact, not copy-paste, so they no longer surface as clone groups on a first run.\n\nThe OR-merge could not express opt-out, so `DupesOptions.ignore_imports` (and the programmatic `DuplicationOptions`) became `Option<bool>` resolved by precedence (CLI override > config > default-true) at the single `build_dupes_config` chokepoint. New opt-out flags `--no-ignore-imports` (standalone) and `--dupes-no-ignore-imports` (combined), both `conflicts_with` their opt-in pair. MCP `find_dupes` / `trace_clone` emit `--no-ignore-imports` on `ignore_imports: false` and now name the default in their descriptions and param docs. The VS Code `fallow.duplication.ignoreImports` setting controls both directions (it previously no-op'd on `false`). A human-format-only stderr note points users at the opt-out when import blocks were excluded and clone groups were reported.\n\nScope is ES `import` declarations only; CommonJS `require()` calls and `export ... from` re-export blocks are still counted (extending coverage to those is queued as #1225). Upgraders with a tuned `duplicates.threshold` gate or saved duplication baselines/trends get explicit CHANGELOG notes (the measured percentage drops, so a tuned gate loosens and a one-time baseline/Impact step-down is expected).\n\nFixes #1224.",

The extract layer captures those import spans on `ModuleInfo.client_only_dynamic_import_spans` (CACHE_VERSION bump) and the BFS skips an edge reached only through them.\n- **Direct case**: a `\"use client\"` file that itself imports a server-only sink is reported with a single self-hop trace; the transitive emit is gated so it reports once.\n- Opt-in and candidate-framed (never a verified vulnerability); `security_findings` stays out of bare `fallow` / `audit`. `SecuritySchemaVersion` bumped to V7 since `client-server-leak` findings can now carry the `server-only-import` category.\n\nTeam review: rust, json-output, mcp reviewers (zero BLOCKs); the direct-case coverage gap, the V7 schema bump, stale doc/schema descriptions, a misleading fixture comment, and thin sink-predicate fixtures were all addressed with new tests. Full workspace test, clippy, fmt, doc, codegen, and the security smoke (10 findings, `schema_version: 7`, zero under bare `fallow`) green.",

The mute toggle asks the language server to re-drive its diagnostic refresh (the path used after analysis and on file reopen, which fires every pull provider unconditionally) instead of relying only on a client-side per-document re-pull that could silently match nothing.\n\nServer: new fallow/refreshDiagnostics custom request that re-drives workspace/diagnostic/refresh (gated on whether the client pulls). Client: the toggle sends it fire-and-forget (swallowing MethodNotFound on older binaries), keeping the local re-pull as a fast-path fallback.\n\nAdds a Fallow: Reset Hidden Findings (Restart Server) command that clears every editor-side hide and restarts the client, the guaranteed recovery for a stuck-hidden workspace. Because the hidden state is stored per workspace and survives uninstalling the extension and deleting .fallow, the extension also nudges once when everything is hidden, with a one-click Show all findings. CI and the CLI are unaffected by these editor-only filters.\n\nRefs discussion #287.",
