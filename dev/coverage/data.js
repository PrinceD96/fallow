A refactor that merely touches a file already containing a sink passes; a diff the gate cannot compute is a loud exit 2, never a green gate.\n\nThe gate predicate is a separate, stricter pass than the advisory diff filter: it keeps a new sink anchor on an added line or an UntrustedSource/Sink trace hop on an added line, and drops the SecretSource file-level exception and pass-through hops. Exit 8 is dedicated and pure; the gate supersedes --fail-on-issues.

          "message": "feat(security): secret-to-network exfil category with destination signal\n\nAdds an opt-in `secret-to-network` security candidate category (CWE-201): a non-public `process.env` / `import.meta.env` secret reaching a network sink's body/options argument (`fetch` / `axios` / `got` / `http(s).request`) via same-identifier source-backed flow, not module-level co-occurrence.\n\nBecause legitimate auth IS secret-to-network, the category is include-required (admitted only via `security.categories.include`, like `hardcoded-secret`). A new `requires_source_kinds` matcher field gates it to a SECRET source (`process-env` / `import-meta-env`), so request-input-to-fetch stays the `ssrf` category's job. Each candidate carries a destination-host signal (`candidate.network.destination`: the request URL when it is a static literal, usually intended auth, or absent when the destination is dynamic, the higher-signal exfil case) so a reviewing agent triages exfil from intended auth without re-reading source.\n\nThe change also stops treating public-by-convention env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, `REACT_APP_`, ...) as secrets across the catalogue (the shared `is_public_env_var` predicate moved to fallow-types), which also removes a latent false positive from the shipped `secret-pii-log`, and models Vite's `import.meta.env` as a secret source via a new `flatten_member_path` MetaProperty arm. The destination is captured on `SinkSite.url_arg_literal`; `CACHE_VERSION` 137 -> 138. No new IssueKind or schema-version bump (the `candidate.network` field is additive, output-only). Hardcoded-secret-as-source and a provider-match heuristic are reserved follow-ups; the candidate carries no `impact` (the agent's job).\n\nFixes #890.",

Injection shapes that route a request value through one or two intermediate variables (alias, template literal, string concat, or object-literal initializers) are upgraded to arg-level confidence with the trace anchored at the original untrusted read instead of staying module-level.\n\nChaining stays conservative: call, conditional, and property-read initializers do not chain, and a flow that exceeds the hop limit degrades to module-level rather than claiming arg-level confidence. RUST_LOG=debug logs when a chain is dropped for exceeding the limit. Integration fixtures cover two-hop, three-hop, and over-limit four-hop flows, and the detection docs describe the bounded chaining behavior.\n\nFixes #1146.",

Loading a pack never executes project code, and matches report as\npolicy-violation findings identified by <pack>/<rule-id>.\n\nbanned-call matching is segment-aware and import-resolved over the\nexisting callee_uses capture (one child_process.* pattern covers bare\nand node:-prefixed named, namespace, and default imports, including\nliteral-only and zero-argument calls); banned-import matches raw\nspecifiers segment-aware over imports and re-exports with an\nignoreTypeOnly escape hatch. Rules scope via files/exclude globs and\ncarry an optional per-rule severity overriding the rules.\"policy-violation\"\nmaster (default warn); the exit-code gate reads the effective per-finding\nseverity. Findings flow through human, JSON, SARIF, CodeClimate, compact,\nand markdown output, LSP diagnostics, baselines, audit attribution,\nregression counts, workspace and issue filters, and the GitHub Action and\nGitLab CI summaries. The fallow rule-pack-schema command prints the pack\nJSON Schema, committed at the repo root so documented $schema URLs\nresolve, and invalid packs fail config load loudly with exit code 2.\n\nFixes #1148.",
