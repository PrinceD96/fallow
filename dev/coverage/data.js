On worktree checkouts cut from origin/main whose local main is never updated, this diffed every branch against an ancient base and could fail the agent gate on a one-line change (the agent-gate twin of #242).\n\nauto_detect_base_ref now resolves to the git merge-base (fork point) against the branch's upstream or the remote default (origin/HEAD, origin/main, origin/master), falling back to the upstream/remote tip on merge-base failure and to local main/master when there is no origin. A new FALLOW_AUDIT_BASE env var pins the base; the audit scope line, an additive-optional base_description JSON field, and the VS Code extension surface the resolved base with provenance.\n\nCloses #1168.",

Injection shapes that route a request value through one or two intermediate variables (alias, template literal, string concat, or object-literal initializers) are upgraded to arg-level confidence with the trace anchored at the original untrusted read instead of staying module-level.\n\nChaining stays conservative: call, conditional, and property-read initializers do not chain, and a flow that exceeds the hop limit degrades to module-level rather than claiming arg-level confidence. RUST_LOG=debug logs when a chain is dropped for exceeding the limit. Integration fixtures cover two-hop, three-hop, and over-limit four-hop flows, and the detection docs describe the bounded chaining behavior.\n\nFixes #1146.",

Empty-project output stays byte-identical to the previous template, pinned by a regression test.",

The rule-id-shaped token (and its\nplural) now parse as aliases of the boundary family kind, so either\ntoken suppresses import, coverage, and call findings alike, and the\nalias is consumed rather than surfaced as an unknown-kind stale\nsuppression.\n\nThe boundary-calls human section now ends with a suppress hint naming\nthe working token, and the explain guide for\nfallow/boundary-call-violation spells out the one-family-token model\nwith the alias noted. README and detection notes lead the forbidden-call\nrollout with a staged warn-then-error path, correct the optional-chaining\nclaim (cp?.exec() call sites are matched), and document that the check\ncovers direct callee paths only. Test pins cover optional-chaining\ncapture, re-bound callees staying quiet, and written-form dedupe.\n\nFixes #1147",

          "message": "fix: credit Playwright fixture wrapper members\n\nPlaywright projects can compose typed fixture test objects through `mergeTests(...)` and wrapper `.extend(...)` calls. The direct fixture correlation already credited page-object methods, but wrapper test objects lost the fixture definition side of that correlation, so `unused-class-members` reported methods that were only reached through merged or extended fixtures.\n\nThis adds a conservative Playwright fixture alias sentinel in extraction and expands those aliases in the unused-member analyzer with a bounded, deduped fixed-point pass. The import gate only accepts Playwright's named `mergeTests` import, including aliased imports, and unmatched wrapper aliases do not credit anything. Namespace imports remain out of scope.\n\nRegression coverage includes extractor alias tests, a full issue fixture covering direct, merged, extended, and transitive wrapper paths, and controls proving genuinely unused decorated methods still report.\n\nFixes #1210.",

Token-identical sorted import blocks are a formatting artifact, not copy-paste, so they no longer surface as clone groups on a first run.\n\nThe OR-merge could not express opt-out, so `DupesOptions.ignore_imports` (and the programmatic `DuplicationOptions`) became `Option<bool>` resolved by precedence (CLI override > config > default-true) at the single `build_dupes_config` chokepoint. New opt-out flags `--no-ignore-imports` (standalone) and `--dupes-no-ignore-imports` (combined), both `conflicts_with` their opt-in pair. MCP `find_dupes` / `trace_clone` emit `--no-ignore-imports` on `ignore_imports: false` and now name the default in their descriptions and param docs. The VS Code `fallow.duplication.ignoreImports` setting controls both directions (it previously no-op'd on `false`). A human-format-only stderr note points users at the opt-out when import blocks were excluded and clone groups were reported.\n\nScope is ES `import` declarations only; CommonJS `require()` calls and `export ... from` re-export blocks are still counted (extending coverage to those is queued as #1225). Upgraders with a tuned `duplicates.threshold` gate or saved duplication baselines/trends get explicit CHANGELOG notes (the measured percentage drops, so a tuned gate loosens and a one-time baseline/Impact step-down is expected).\n\nFixes #1224.",

The extract layer captures those import spans on `ModuleInfo.client_only_dynamic_import_spans` (CACHE_VERSION bump) and the BFS skips an edge reached only through them.\n- **Direct case**: a `\"use client\"` file that itself imports a server-only sink is reported with a single self-hop trace; the transitive emit is gated so it reports once.\n- Opt-in and candidate-framed (never a verified vulnerability); `security_findings` stays out of bare `fallow` / `audit`. `SecuritySchemaVersion` bumped to V7 since `client-server-leak` findings can now carry the `server-only-import` category.\n\nTeam review: rust, json-output, mcp reviewers (zero BLOCKs); the direct-case coverage gap, the V7 schema bump, stale doc/schema descriptions, a misleading fixture comment, and thin sink-predicate fixtures were all addressed with new tests. Full workspace test, clippy, fmt, doc, codegen, and the security smoke (10 findings, `schema_version: 7`, zero under bare `fallow`) green.",

Client: the toggle sends it fire-and-forget (swallowing MethodNotFound on older binaries), keeping the local re-pull as a fast-path fallback.\n\nAdds a Fallow: Reset Hidden Findings (Restart Server) command that clears every editor-side hide and restarts the client, the guaranteed recovery for a stuck-hidden workspace.
