A new `requires_source_kinds` matcher field gates it to a SECRET source (`process-env` / `import-meta-env`), so request-input-to-fetch stays the `ssrf` category's job. Each candidate carries a destination-host signal (`candidate.network.destination`: the request URL when it is a static literal, usually intended auth, or absent when the destination is dynamic, the higher-signal exfil case) so a reviewing agent triages exfil from intended auth without re-reading source.\n\nThe change also stops treating public-by-convention env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, `REACT_APP_`, ...) as secrets across the catalogue (the shared `is_public_env_var` predicate moved to fallow-types), which also removes a latent false positive from the shipped `secret-pii-log`, and models Vite's `import.meta.env` as a secret source via a new `flatten_member_path` MetaProperty arm. The destination is captured on `SinkSite.url_arg_literal`; `CACHE_VERSION` 137 -> 138. No new IssueKind or schema-version bump (the `candidate.network` field is additive, output-only). Hardcoded-secret-as-source and a provider-match heuristic are reserved follow-ups; the candidate carries no `impact` (the agent's job).\n\nFixes #890.",

Treat large one-line JS assets as generated output during source discovery while the max-file-size guard is enabled.\n\nThe discovery walk now records skipped minified assets as skipped-minified-file diagnostics, keeps --max-file-size 0 as the opt-out, and leaves declaration files plus large multiline JS in the analyzed set. The output schema, generated TypeScript contracts, and CLI reference now document the new diagnostic kind.\n\nFixes #1086.",

          "message": "feat(security): chain tainted local bindings through up to three hops (#1171)\n\nfallow security now traces untrusted input through chained same-module local bindings, up to three hops. Injection shapes that route a request value through one or two intermediate variables (alias, template literal, string concat, or object-literal initializers) are upgraded to arg-level confidence with the trace anchored at the original untrusted read instead of staying module-level.\n\nChaining stays conservative: call, conditional, and property-read initializers do not chain, and a flow that exceeds the hop limit degrades to module-level rather than claiming arg-level confidence. RUST_LOG=debug logs when a chain is dropped for exceeding the limit. Integration fixtures cover two-hop, three-hop, and over-limit four-hop flows, and the detection docs describe the bounded chaining behavior.\n\nFixes #1146.",

Token-identical sorted import blocks are a formatting artifact, not copy-paste, so they no longer surface as clone groups on a first run.\n\nThe OR-merge could not express opt-out, so `DupesOptions.ignore_imports` (and the programmatic `DuplicationOptions`) became `Option<bool>` resolved by precedence (CLI override > config > default-true) at the single `build_dupes_config` chokepoint. New opt-out flags `--no-ignore-imports` (standalone) and `--dupes-no-ignore-imports` (combined), both `conflicts_with` their opt-in pair. MCP `find_dupes` / `trace_clone` emit `--no-ignore-imports` on `ignore_imports: false` and now name the default in their descriptions and param docs. The VS Code `fallow.duplication.ignoreImports` setting controls both directions (it previously no-op'd on `false`). A human-format-only stderr note points users at the opt-out when import blocks were excluded and clone groups were reported.\n\nScope is ES `import` declarations only; CommonJS `require()` calls and `export ... from` re-export blocks are still counted (extending coverage to those is queued as #1225). Upgraders with a tuned `duplicates.threshold` gate or saved duplication baselines/trends get explicit CHANGELOG notes (the measured percentage drops, so a tuned gate loosens and a one-time baseline/Impact step-down is expected).\n\nFixes #1224.",

          "message": "fix(impact): isolate the CI record-gate in unit tests\n\nrecord_audit_run / record_combined_run short-circuit on telemetry::is_ci()\nso Impact never records on CI. The unit tests run on CI too (GitHub Actions\nsets CI / GITHUB_ACTIONS), so that gate made 16 record-dependent impact tests\nwrite nothing and fail on the Linux and Windows runners while passing on a\ndeveloper's machine where CI is unset.\n\nRoute the gate through a record_gate_is_ci() helper that, under #[cfg(test)],\nreads a per-test TEST_FORCE_CI thread-local (default false) instead of the\nambient env, mirroring the existing TEST_CONFIG_DIR isolation. Tests now record\ninto their isolated temp store regardless of the suite's CI environment, and a\nnew record_is_a_noop_in_ci test forces the override true to pin the production\ngate. The release binary is unchanged: under #[cfg(not(test))] the helper is\nexactly telemetry::is_ci(), so the feature's CI behavior is untouched.",
